# tic_tac_toe-Game
Create a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML and CSS that allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The game highlights the winning combinations and provides a restart button for a new game. With responsive design, it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
